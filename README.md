# inventory_manager
This project started as a homework assignment for my coding class.
It involved creating a store inventory manager that runs in the terminal.
My original solution was one file and used methods and case statements to navigate the various menus.

This worked just fine but was far from the best solution.
I decided go back to and refactor it using an mvc model.
